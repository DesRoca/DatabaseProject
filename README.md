Database - Fall 2021

Languages - mySQl, PHP, HTML, CSS

We used our terminal to sign into our eve accounts we were able to grant ourselves the permissions required to edit, add, remove, and other options for tables to hold information. Once we got comfortable with all the SQL commands, we were able to finally incorporate what we learned and use it with a simple website.
